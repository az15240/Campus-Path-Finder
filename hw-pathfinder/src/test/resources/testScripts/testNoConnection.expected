# Tests the Dijkstra function on two disconnected nodes in a graph

created graph g

added node A to g
added node B to g
added node C to g

added edge 1.000 from A to B in g
added edge 2.000 from B to A in g
added edge 3.000 from A to A in g

g contains: A B C

the children of A in g are: A(3.000) B(1.000)

path from A to C:
no path found
path from C to A:
no path found
