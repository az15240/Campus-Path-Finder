# Test a special edge that connects from and to the same node.
# Graph A consists of three nodes, each having such a special edge.
# Graph B consists of three nodes, two of them have a special edge, and one edge connecting
# these two nodes, and one edge connecting one of these nodes and the other node.

created graph A
added node n1 to A
added edge 1.000 from n1 to n1 in A
the children of n1 in A are: n1(1.000)
added node n2 to A
added edge 2.000 from n2 to n2 in A
the children of n2 in A are: n2(2.000)
added node n3 to A
added edge 3.000 from n3 to n3 in A
the children of n3 in A are: n3(3.000)
A contains: n1 n2 n3

created graph B
added node n1 to B
added edge 10.000 from n1 to n1 in B
the children of n1 in B are: n1(10.000)
added node n2 to B
added edge 20.000 from n2 to n2 in B
the children of n2 in B are: n2(20.000)
added edge 12.000 from n1 to n2 in B
the children of n1 in B are: n1(10.000) n2(12.000)
added node n3 to B
added edge 13.000 from n1 to n3 in B
the children of n1 in B are: n1(10.000) n2(12.000) n3(13.000)
B contains: n1 n2 n3

path from n1 to n1:
total cost: 0.000
path from n1 to n3:
n1 to n3 with weight 13.000
