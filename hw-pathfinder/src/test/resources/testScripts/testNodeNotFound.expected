# Tests the special case for the Dijkstra function in which one or two given nodes are not found

created graph g

added node A to g
added node B to g
added node C to g

added edge 1.000 from A to B in g
added edge 2.000 from B to A in g
added edge 3.000 from A to C in g

g contains: A B C

the children of A in g are: B(1.000) C(3.000)
