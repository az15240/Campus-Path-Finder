# Tests the Dijkstra algorithm on a simple graph with five node

created graph g

added node A to g
added node B to g
added node C to g
added node D to g
added node E to g

added edge 1.000 from A to B in g
added edge 2.000 from A to C in g
added edge 2.000 from A to D in g
added edge 1.000 from B to D in g
added edge 3.000 from C to D in g
added edge 10.000 from B to C in g
added edge 2.000 from D to E in g

g contains: A B C D E

the children of A in g are: B(1.000) C(2.000) D(2.000)

path from A to B:
A to B with weight 1.000
total cost: 1.000
path from A to C:
A to C with weight 2.000
total cost: 2.000
path from A to D:
A to D with weight 2.000
total cost: 2.000
path from A to E:
A to D with weight 2.000
D to E with weight 2.000
total cost: 4.000
