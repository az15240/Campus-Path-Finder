# Test the numerically sorted output

created graph A
added node n1 to A
added node n2 to A
added node n3 to A
added edge 999.000 from n1 to n3 in A
added edge 10.000 from n1 to n1 in A
added edge 9.200 from n1 to n2 in A
added edge 3.200 from n1 to n2 in A
added edge 1.000 from n1 to n1 in A
added edge 123.000 from n1 to n3 in A
added edge 0.100 from n1 to n2 in A
added edge 1.200 from n1 to n2 in A
added edge 3.142 from n1 to n3 in A

the children of n1 in A are: n1(1.000) n1(10.000) n2(0.100) n2(1.200) n2(3.200) n2(9.200) n3(3.142) n3(123.000) n3(999.000)
the children of n2 in A are:
the children of n3 in A are:
