Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-pathfinder,
and why you made those changes.

Removed many unnecessary methods. They over rely on Strings as the "index" for locating a Node
or Edge, and this is not well supported after introducing generics.

Added containsNode in Graph class. This method helps check if a node is in the current graph.

Added getChildrenFromNodeReturnValueSet in Graph class. This method directly retuns a set of edges
that have their start node as the given node. Very useful in my Dijkstra method when it needs to explore
all following edges from a node.
