# Test a graph with islands. Island means having discontinuous pieces of sub-graphs.
# Graph ('A') and graph ('B') all have two islands.

created graph A
# Create the first island
added node n1 to A
added node n2 to A
added node n3 to A
added edge e12 from n1 to n2 in A
added edge e23 from n2 to n3 in A
added edge e31 from n3 to n1 in A
# Create the second island - only a single node
added node n4 to A
A contains: n1 n2 n3 n4
the children of n1 in A are: n2(e12)
the children of n2 in A are: n3(e23)
the children of n3 in A are: n1(e31)
the children of n4 in A are:
