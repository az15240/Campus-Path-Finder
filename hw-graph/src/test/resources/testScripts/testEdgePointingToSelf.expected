# Test a special edge that connects from and to the same node.
# Graph A consists of three nodes, each having such a special edge.
# Graph B consists of three nodes, two of them have a special edge, and one edge connecting
# these two nodes, and one edge connecting one of these nodes and the other node.

created graph A
added node n1 to A
added edge e1 from n1 to n1 in A
the children of n1 in A are: n1(e1)
added node n2 to A
added edge e2 from n2 to n2 in A
the children of n2 in A are: n2(e2)
added node n3 to A
added edge e3 from n3 to n3 in A
the children of n3 in A are: n3(e3)
A contains: n1 n2 n3

created graph B
added node n1 to B
added edge e11 from n1 to n1 in B
the children of n1 in B are: n1(e11)
added node n2 to B
added edge e22 from n2 to n2 in B
the children of n2 in B are: n2(e22)
added edge e12 from n1 to n2 in B
the children of n1 in B are: n1(e11) n1(e12)
added node n3 to B
added edge e13 from n1 to n3 in B
the children of n1 in B are: n1(e11) n1(e12) n1(e13)
B contains: n1 n2 n3
