# Test a graph with two nodes and edges connecting them.
# Graph ('A') have one edge, graph ('B') have three edges pointing from the same node to the
# same targeted node, graph ('C') have three edges not necessarily pointing from the same node
# to the same targeted node.

created graph A
added node n1 to A
added node n2 to A
the children of n1 in A are:
the children of n2 in A are:
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in A
A contains: n1 n2
the children of n1 in A are: n2(e1)
the children of n2 in A are:

created graph B
added node n1 to B
added node n2 to B
B contains: n1 n2
added edge e1 from n1 to n2 in B

the children of n2 in B are:
added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in B
the children of n1 in B are: n2(e1) n2(e2)
the children of n2 in B are:
added edge e3 from n1 to n2 in B
the children of n1 in B are: n2(e1) n2(e2) n2(e3)

created graph C
added node n1 to C
added node n2 to C
C contains: n1 n2
