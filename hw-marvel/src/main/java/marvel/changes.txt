Briefly list any changes you made to your graph class during hw-marvel,
and why you made those changes.

I removed all unnecessary functionalities not used in the program, because they would cost so long time and resources to
run. Also, they are some really bad designs so I decide to remove all of them. It also prevents me from maintaining them
in the future.
In particular, I almost cleared all previous reliance on using names or labels of nodes and edges in my graph class. Each
time when my program is finding a node or edge by its name or label, the program have to go through the collection of
the node or edge to find the thing I want. This costs a lot of time so I removed them. I reconstructed everything. Instead
it can simply create a new node or edge and thanks to the new .equals method, nodes are recognized by their name and
edges are recognized by their label and start and end nodes. It saves a lot of time and eventually allows the program to
run under 30 seconds.

Also, I changed the representation invariant of my Edge class and Graph class. Because now the labels, being comic book
names, can be same, so the previous invariant saying that all Edges should have different label now does not hold. I
simply removed this representation invariant and changes the find edge method in Graph class by requiring two parameters
for the start node and the end node.
