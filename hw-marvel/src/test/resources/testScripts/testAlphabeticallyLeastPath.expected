# Test alphabetically least paths. Only four nodes are provided but various edges are between them.

created graph g

added node n1 to g
added node n2 to g
added node n3 to g
added node n4 to g

added edge e2 from n1 to n2 in g
added edge e3 from n1 to n2 in g
added edge e1 from n1 to n3 in g
added edge e4 from n1 to n3 in g
added edge e7 from n2 to n4 in g
added edge e8 from n2 to n4 in g
added edge e5 from n3 to n4 in g
added edge e6 from n3 to n4 in g

g contains: n1 n2 n3 n4

the children of n1 in g are: n2(e2) n2(e3) n3(e1) n3(e4)
